          <h3>The Cavern</h3>
          <p>
            You and your party of seasoned adventurers are in the middle of a
            dark cave. You have been traveling for days now and it seems that
            there is no end to the twists and turns of these cold dark tunnels.
            You think that this must be the cave that the old wizard told you
            about at the Blue Birch Tavern. Thinking about the occasion with the
            peculiar man, you remember something that did not seem that strange
            at the time, but now has been haunting your thoughts. He said, “<b>In
            the dark of the cavern, I had to make a choice. A choice which has
            cursed me my whole life...</b> even in my old age.” You think to
            yourself, “What was that choice? Must I make the same choice?”

          <h3>Discovery</h3>
          <p>
            After about an hour of brooding over that conversation with the old
            wizard, Rezzing, an Elven Ranger that has been by your side for many
            adventures, speaks up, “<b>What is that!?</b>” You and your comrades look
            over in his direction, and to your surprise you see a small symbol,
            about the size of your palm, etched on the wall. That is the first
            sign of intelligent life you’ve seen in three days. At least you
            think it’s been three days… The group examines the small engraving
            on the wall. Fen’inu, the Wizard, says, “I think I have seen this
            symbol once before. It was in the Book of Shadow Magic.”<br />“You’ve
            read the Cursed Tome?” interjects Rezzing.<br />“Yes, it was part of
            my studies in the land of Fayh’leh. As I was saying, the Book of
            Shadow Magic said that it is a spell that connects to the earth. It
            should be harmless as long as we do not touch it.”<br />“Oh dear...”
            says Rezzing as his face turns white with fear, “I touched the
            symbol right before I told you about it.”<br />“<b>What?! No!</b>” Fayh’leh
            replies looking frantic.<br />

          <h3>Danger</h3>
          <p>
            Before another second passes by, the earth beneath you, like a
            living creature, reels back, and you and your comrades fall into the
            dark below... The fall was not too far and you did not get too badly
            hurt. You look around and notice, to your shock, that there are
            lanterns on the walls of this large room. There are doors on the far
            sides of the room. As everyone struggles to get their bearings, you
            notice, to your shock, that the doors are opening. You cry out to
            your companions, but before they understand what’s happening, two
            groups of six armed men charge out of each of the doors. You draw
            your sword and charge forward attacking the first one.<br />
            <i
              >“Nope, you can’t do that!” says Mike, the Dungeon Master. He
              continues, “These guys are sixty feet away, so you can’t cover
              that distance and make an attack in your turn.”</i
            ><br />
            Instead of charging forward, you help Fen’inu to his feet and take
            your shield out of your pack. <b>You ready yourself for battle</b>. You
            notice that your foe is taking on a strange battle formation, that
            you haven’t seen before.
            <i
              >“Okay,” you tell Mike, “you can’t just say that it’s a strange
              battle formation that I’ve never seen before. Give me some
              details.”<br />“Oh, right. It's an S shape.” Mike replies, as he
              begins drawing on a piece of paper. “Like this.”<br />“That's a Z
              shape. How big is it? How far apart are they spaced? Where's the
              front of the line?”<br />“Uhhh...”</i
